####Session 4: Performance Testing workshop

This session will help you get started with JMeter (an opensource tool) for performance testing.

Performance Testing is a very deep topic and is quite technical in nature. It will help a lot if you read through the suggested material before coming in for the session. 

During the session, we will spend more time fiddling hands-on with Jmeter rather than talking about the basics of performance testing (which IMO is covered by the suggested reading material).

Some things we'll cover are:
- Basic components/elements of Jmeter
- Record/Playback
- Editing and parameterizing your scripts
- Assertions
- Reading Test data from CSV files 
- Debugging your scripts
- Monitoring and analysing results
- etc
